tempus

Version 1.0

DESCRIPTION 

Annotation tool.  Accepts VCF input file and outputs a tab-delimited annotated file.

Outputs the following columns:

1) Chromosome
2) Position (Start position if >1 base)
3) Reference allele
4) Alternate allele
5) Depth (from VCF DP format field)
6) Reads supporting Alternate allele (from VCF DPR format field)
7) Percent Reads supporting Alternate allele vs. Reads supporting the Reference allele (from VCF)
8) Allele Frequency (from EXAC)
9) Variant type (from VCF TYPE info field)
10) Variant Type/Consequence (from EXAC; if multiple types, most deleterious type selected based on Ensembl estimate of severity)

Notes:

1) Tool assumes VCF contains two samples and only processes the second sample.
2) Tool identifies VCF FORMAT tag/id order from first variant and assumes all variants have same ordering (i.e, all variants have the following FORMAT field  GT:GQ:DP:DPR:RO:QR:AO:QA).
3) If no data available, annotation output field will contain '-'.


INSTALLATION

The easiest way to use "tempus" is to use the precompiled binary (created using gcc 4.4.7 on CentOS 6.8) in ./dist/

If desired, "tempus" may be created from source code by running the following from the command line:

make


USAGE

Usage: tempus -i <VCF-formatted input file> -o <Annotated output file> [optional parameters]

Required Parameters:
	-i 	VCF-formatted input file
	-o 	Annotated output file

Optional Parameters:
	-s 	SO terms file [SO_terms_sorted_by_ensembl_estimated_severity.txt]

Other Parameters:
	-h 	Print help
